# X's and O's (Tic Tac Toe/Noughts & Crosses)
## Introduction
The aim of this project was to create a site that allowed visitors to play X's and O's (Tic Tac Toe/Noughts and Crosses) against each other.
### Target Audience
* Anyone who wants to play this classic game online instead of using a pen and paper
### User Stories
From a user perspective:
  * I'd like to know which player will start the game
  * I'd like to see the board being updated on every move
  * I'd like to see a message showing if a player picks a position that has already been taken & must pick a different spot
  * I'd like to see a message congratulating the winner or saying the game was a tie
  * I'd like to be asked if I want to play the game again
